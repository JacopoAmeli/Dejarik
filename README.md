# Dejarik
A Star Wars holochess passion project. 
I started working on this project in October of 2017 and I stopped one month later in November.
It was initially just a way for me to learn how to use Unity. I found old rules for the "Dejarik" game (the Star Wars holochess game, that you should let a Wookie win) and decided to make a videogame out of those.
After implementing the basic rules in a normal versus mode, I contacted my AI professor at my university and decided together that I would make an AI using a classic A* tree search algorithm for non-deterministic games. 
This ended up being more complicated than I thought because of Unity's handling of threads or its lack of it, but it was more educational as a result.
